		<h1>Cup Of Coffee</h1>
		<p>
			Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning 
			brew probably arenâ€™t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And 
			yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 
			coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health
			 Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the 
			 beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the 
			 contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who
			  drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for.
			   Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in 
			   moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then 
			   in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear 
			   a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.
