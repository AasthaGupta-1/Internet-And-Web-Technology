		<p>
			A smartphone is a cell phone that lets you do more than make phone 
			calls and send text messages. Smartphones can browse the Internet and 
			run software programs like a computer. Smartphones use a touch screen 
			to allow users to interact with them. There are thousands of smartphone 
			apps including games, personal-use, and business-use programs that all 
			run on the phone. The picture is an example of the Apple iPhone, a 
			popular smartphone.
